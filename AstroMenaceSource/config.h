// VBO OpenGL extention support switcher (if defined - game will detect and use VBO) Game could crash
// in FreeBSD under VirtualBox if vbo are used. Added just in case, if hardware capabilities detection fail.
// Looks like only virtualized systems could have this issue.
#define vbo

// VAO OpenGL extention support switcher (if defined - game will detect and use VAO), VAO will not work without VBO
// Intel video cards might have a problem with VAO (index buffer issue in intel video drivers)
#define vao

// FBO OpenGL extention support switcher (if defined - game will detect and use FBO)
// Note, this will also take affect on anti aliasing support.
#define fbo

// xinerama support, required libXinerama
#ifdef xinerama_detected_by_cmake // do not comment this line, unless you are sure what are you doing
	#define xinerama

// joystick support, required SDL compilled with "joystick" flag
#define joystick

// separate thread for music during data loading (based on SDL multithread implementation)
// #define multithread

// compression during gamedata.vfs creation, game will take more time for loading in exchange of size reducing (about 30 MB)
// #define compression

// define DATADIR with gamedata.vfs file location if you don't put it together in the same directory with binary file.
// Use cmake with DATADIR flag OR uncomment line below
// #define DATADIR "/usr/share/astromenace"

// game configuration file will be stored with game binary file
// #define portable

// fontconfig support.
// With fontconfig you don't need fonts bundled with game, system TrueType, Type 1 or CFF fonts will be used instead.
// Make sure, that you have at least one installed bold style TrueType, Type 1 or CFF font with en, de and ru languages support.
// RAW_VFS_DATA/FONT/ folder can be removed in case of fontconfig use.
#ifdef fontconfig_detected_by_cmake // do not comment this line, unless you are sure what are you doing

// Default font family for game text rendering in case of fontconfig use.
// Please note, font family name could be vary in different distros.
// Recomended fonts as dafault game font (were tested for correct ingame text rendering):
// 1) Linux Libertine/Linux Biolinum

//#define default_font_family "Linux Libertine O"
// 2) Liberation Fonts
//#define default_font_family "Liberation Mono"

// Since game use content released under different licenses (GPL v3, OFL v1.1, CC BY-SA v3.0),
// you might need create separate VFS game data file (gamedata_cc.vfs) with CC BY-SA licensed content only.
// If not defined, all content merged into one VFS game data file (gamedata.vfs)
// #define separate_cc_vfs





// You can create standalone AstroMenaceFS2VFS util for gamedata.vfs file creation.
// Use cmake with FS2VFS flag OR
// Use CodeBlocks.cbp project file (you will need Code::Blocks IDE) with "FS2VFS Linux GCC" as Build target OR
// 1) Uncomment "#define vfs_pack_standalone" line
// 2) Make sure, that your compilation list consist only 4 source files:
//			MainFS2VFS.cpp
//			Core/VirtualFileSystem/VFS.cpp
//			Core/VirtualFileSystem/Haff.cpp
//			Core/VirtualFileSystem/RLE.cpp
//    and you have 2 header files - config.h and Core/VirtualFileSystem/VFS.h close to them.
//
// #define vfs_pack_standalone





// more actions and text outputs with debug information for bug hunting
// #define gamedebug

// PNG image format support via libpng.
// #define png

// JPEG image format support via libjpeg.
